# ccgu: Cohesionless collection of generic utilities

This is a small gathering place for utility functions that were worth generalizing. Each utility is
kept in one header file in the `include` directory. Benchmarks and unit test (using
[catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)) builds are configured with [cmake](https://cmake.org),
but this is for testing. Actually using the snippets can be done by copying the desired header file
or copying its content.
